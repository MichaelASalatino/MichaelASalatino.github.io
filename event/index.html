            <h3 class="h3info">Background and development</h3>
            <p class="pinfo">
                Following the conclusion of Rob Zombie's Hellbilly Deluxe 2 World Tour on May 26, 2012, Manson and Zombie underwent negotiations to launch a double bill tour to cover North America and Europe for the remainder of 2012. At the time, Manson was engaged in the worldwide Hey Cruel World... Tour in support of their 8th full-length studio LP, Born Villain, however, Manson was interested with the idea of touring with Zombie. Hence, the tour was conceived as a 'tour within a tour' for Hey Cruel World... Tour.  
            </p>
           <p class="pinfo">
               The tour began on September 28, 2012, in Phoenix, Arizona, at the first annual Desert Uprising Festival at Ashley Furniture Homestore Pavilion. The last show of the North American leg of the tour was on October 31, 2012, near Dallas. Marilyn Manson played in Latin America as part of his own Hey Cruel World... tour until the Twins of Evil tour moved to Europe on November 26, 2012. The tour concluded on December 12, 2012 in Bologna, Italy.</p>
